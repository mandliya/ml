    "In this project, we are going to follow these steps (more or less, as this is just beginning, we might not have all the context, or some step might be very trivial). Let's say at your job, you are given California Census Data to predict median housing price for each block group in California (districts, which typically has population of 600 to 3000).  The data contains various metrices such as population, median income, and median housing prices etc. Let's try to follow the steps above to solve this problem.\n",

    "Let's answer as many questions as possible for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Objective:** The end goal of the project determines how we plan, build and evaluate the model. It should be very clear why we are building the solution? Let's say our model's output will be input to another ML system which along with our output takes many other signals to determine if it is worth investing in an area or not. This is a typical machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Solutions:** What if there are already state of art solutions available for this problem? In that case, why re-invent the wheel? It is good idea to gauge performance and architecture of the existing systems. This gives you reference for approaching the problem. Your boss tells you the current process is manual and have error variation of around 20%. In such case, you will like to get your hands dirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describing the task**: Now, we are designing the system.\n",
    "* Is it a supervised, unsupervised or Reinforcement learning task? Supervised, as we have labeled training examples.\n",
    "* Is it a classification, regression or something else? Is is regression as we are going to predict a value.\n",
    "* Should we use online or batch learning? As there is no continuous data flow coming into the system, there is no requirement to adjust the data rapidly, and the data is small, so we will rely on plain batch learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measuring the performance**: Now, we have to select how do we measure performance of our model. In general, literature will always help you. Performance measure of regression is usually **Root Mean Square Error** (*RMSE*).\n",
    "We will come back to this in detail soon. <font color='blue'>Tag: TBD</font>\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Assumption Check**: We need to list out our and other peoples' assumptions, even the smaller ones to catch the issue early on. For example in this project, We are assuming that we need to give district's median housing prices in the area. This will be a value i.e. a regression problem. However, what if downstream pipline expects a categorical value (e.g. district categorized as high, medium and low for housing price), in that case it will be a classification problem. You confirmed that the stackholders are indeed expecting a value back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Get the data**: Okay, we are now ready to get the data. Let's fetch the data. The author has modified the California Census data to fit the purpose of this project, and also graciously provided the code. I have modified the code a bit! Just to code it on my own."

The numbers represents rougly tens of thousand. So 10 here means 10,000 dollars.\n",
    "2. The housing median values seems to be capped too, and apparently so is housing median age. The housing median value is our target label, so it seems we will not able to accurately make predictions beyond 500,000 as our algorithm will never see larger values than that. Ideally, you should bring this up to your team and boss, so you know where algorithm might not work well. May be better data need to be collected.\n",

Over the time, our machine learning will have seen the whole dataset and it will overfit, i.e. it will not do well for real unseen data. In other words, it will not generalize well, even though it will perform really well for your train and test data.\n",

However, it will still be bad when we have updated dataset, which happens quite often in real scenarios. One solution is to use each instance (or row) identifier, and always put them in either test or train. E.g. we can compute a hash of each instance's identifier. If the hash is lower or equal to 20% of the maximum hash value, we put it in test set, else we put it in train set. This way, even if the dataset is updated, the test set will never contain an instance which was previously in training set. Author has provided a quick implementation of it."
